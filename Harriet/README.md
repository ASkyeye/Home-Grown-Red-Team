Meet Harriet!

Harriet was inspired by the Charlotte C++ shellcode loader. This tool uses AES encryption and function/variable obfuscation to get around AV and Windows Defender. At the time of writing, this is only detected by 1 vendor per AntiScan.me and will give you an undetected Meterpreter reverse shell. As we all know, Meterpreter is heavily signatured so you will have to play with the features (getsystem, hashdump,ect) to see what gets caught and what doesn't.
