There are times when you might not have access to the internet to get your favorite Red Team tools. This script serves as a way to set up your Raspberry Pi or Pi Zero W as a file share to get needed scripts in a pinch.

Simply clone the repo and then run the bash script.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! Working on getting all of the dependencies together to auto-install all of the tools instead of just git cloning them. Give me a couple of years, there is a lot of shit here.
