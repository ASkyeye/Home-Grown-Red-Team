# Home-Grown-Red-Team

This repo is a resource for various red teaming techniques and tools based on open source software and non-commerical tools.

All of the tools and tradecraft on this repo will be geared toward using Raspberry Pis and Raspberry Pi Zero Ws instead of commerical implants like the Rubbery Ducky, BashBunny or Wifi Pineapple.
