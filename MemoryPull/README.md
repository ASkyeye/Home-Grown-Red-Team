MemoryPull is a simple (extremely simple) C# shellcode runner that will call out to external server hosting raw shellcode and run it. The URL is hard coded inside the shellcode runner so you don't have enter anything in a command prompt. This is extremely useful for converting EXEs to shellcode with Donut and running them in memory. 

The best thing? You don't need Visual Studio, you can easily compile on Linux with Mono. 

Drop to disk if you want. It's FUD.
